Description: These datasets provide detailed SOL test results at the district level, including subject-area performance, test-by-test breakdowns, and student participation rates. This data can be used to analyze student performance trends across various subjects within specific districts, allowing for comparisons between regions or schools to understand factors that influence academic outcomes.

End Goal:

Correlation Analysis: This project aims to examine the relationship between various socioeconomic factors and SOL pass rates across subjects and school divisions. By identifying key socioeconomic variables that impact student performance, the analysis seeks to uncover trends and disparities among districts.
