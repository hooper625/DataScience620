Description: These datasets provide detailed SOL test results at the district level, including subject-area performance, test-by-test breakdowns, and student participation rates. This data can be used to analyze student performance trends across various subjects within specific districts, allowing for comparisons between regions or schools to understand factors that influence academic outcomes.

End Goal:

Correlation Analysis: The objective of this project is to explore the correlation between poverty, household income, and educational attainment levels, and how they influence SOL pass rates across subjects and school divisions. By focusing on key socioeconomic variables, we aim to identify trends and disparities in performance across different districts, with an emphasis on uncovering the impact of poverty and income on educational outcomes.
