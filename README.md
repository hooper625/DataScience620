Description: These datasets provide detailed SOL test results at the district level, including subject-area performance, test-by-test breakdowns, and student participation rates. This data can be used to analyze student performance trends across various subjects within specific districts, allowing for comparisons between regions or schools to understand factors that influence academic outcomes.

End Goal:

Correlation Analysis: The goal of this project is to analyze how different socioeconomic factors (from another dataset) correlate with SOL pass rates across subjects and school divisions. By identifying key socioeconomic variables that influence performance, we aim to uncover trends and disparities across districts.
